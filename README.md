$ cd foundations-checkpoint-2
```


## Complete the specs

3. Before completing each spec, read the README.md File located in each folder.
4. Write your code in each `solution_*.js` file so that you can pass the specs in located in the `*_specs.js` files.
5. Run the test specs to test your code. To run the specs for a directory, you need to go into that directory and run the command `testem`.

```
$ cd foundations-checkpoint-2
