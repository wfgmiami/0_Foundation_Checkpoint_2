### Use Reduce

#### 3 Points


In 06_Functional in Test First, you created your own `reduce` function.  Just like the `Array.prototype.map function`, `reduce` is also a built in method on the Array.prototype.  Use the Array.prototype.reduce method in the problem below.

Use the Array.prototype.reduce method to get the sum of values in the "callReduceOnThisArray" with a **starting value of 100**.  After calling the reduce method, the value returned should be 115.

Call the reduce method on:

`var callReduceOnThisArray = [1,2,3,4,5];` //115

** PUT YOUR CODE IN THE TEST SPECS, YOU DO NOT NEED TO CREATE A NEW FILE **
